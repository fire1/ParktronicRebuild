Parking sensor Rebuild
==============
In this project I will rebuild the "Brain" for cheap parking sensors that comes from China by replacing microcontroller IC with Arduino Pro mini.
 My variant is 8 sensors set, but ordinary 4-set will work to. 
 
 _In "[stuff](https://github.com/fire1/ParktronicRebuild/tree/master/stuff)" folder you can find useful stuff, used library and pin remap to Arduino._
 
 **Project Note**
 
 This should be a very simple project, remove the IC from the board, solder wires from IC socket to Arduino and upload the code.
