Parking sensor Rebuild
==============
In this project I will rebuild the "Brain" for cheap parking sensors that comes from China by replacing microcontroller IC with Arduino Pro mini.
 My variant is 8 sensors set, but ordinary 4-set will work to. 
 In "documents" folder you can find useful stuff and pin remap to Arduino.
